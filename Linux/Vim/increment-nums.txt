:h v_g_CTRL-A

{Visual}g CTRL-A    Add [count] to the number or alphabetic character in
            the highlighted text. If several lines are
                highlighted, each one will be incremented by an
            additional [count] (so effectively creating a
            [count] incrementing sequence).
            For Example, if you have this list of numbers:
                1. ~
                1. ~
                1. ~
                1. ~
            Move to the second "1." and Visually select three
            lines, pressing g CTRL-A results in:
                1. ~
                2. ~
                3. ~
                4. ~
