before running `ansible-playbook main.yml`,
be sure to edit `templates/pi-hole-docker-compose.yml.j2`.
remove below
```
    ports:
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "67:67/udp"
{% if domain_name_enable and domain_name and domain_pihole %}
      - "38080:80/tcp"
{% else %}
      - "80:80/tcp"
{% endif %}
      - "443:443/tcp"
```

add instead
```
    network_mode: host
    privileged: true
```

this will allow the pi-hole Docker container to share Pi's networking namespace, allowing it to directly access the network

On the router, I set a static IPv4 address 192.168.1.73 for the pihole
Also, on the pihole itself, I set its IPv4 address to static 192.168.1.73 `rock@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.73`
I believe it thought its IPv4 address lease would expire after 24 hours and thus would drop itself off the LAN? IDK
