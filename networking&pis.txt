1. Figure out the IP of router and your device
	If CMD/Powershell: 
		`ipconfig`
			"Default Gateway IPv4 IP" = router IP
			"IPv4 Address" = your device IP

	If Bash: 
		`ip route show`
			"default via" = router IP
		`ifconfig`
			"wlan0 inet" = your device IP
		
2. Ping a range of IPs on the router to discover devices
	`nmap -sn X.X.X.X/24`
    a. If you have sudo, you may be able to see names of devices
	`sudo nmap -sn X.X.X.X/24`

3. Investigate open ports on a device
	`nmap -Pn X.X.X.X`

-------Accessing Raspberry Pi

1. If you're on the same wifi as your raspberry pi,
