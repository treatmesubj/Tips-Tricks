1. Figure out the IP of router and your device
	If CMD/Powershell: 
		`ipconfig`
			"Default Gateway IPv4 IP" = router IP
			"IPv4 Address" = your device IP

	If Bash: 
		`ip route show`
			"default via" = router IP
		`ifconfig`
			"wlan0 inet" = your device IP
		
2. Ping a range of IPs on the router to discover devices
	`nmap -sn X.X.X.X/24`
    a. If you have sudo, you may be able to see names of devices
	`sudo nmap -sn X.X.X.X/24`

3. Investigate open ports on a device
	`nmap -Pn X.X.X.X`

-------Accessing Raspberry Pi

1. If you're on the same wifi as your raspberry pi,
	`ping raspberrypi.local`

2. SSH into pi
	Pi Setup
		a. may be handy to have pi auto-connect to wifi
			1. will need new file in boot directory: "wpa_supplicant.conf"
				```
				ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
				update_config=1
				country=US
				network = {
				ssid="your wifi network name"
				psk="wifi password"
				key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
				}
				```
		b. will need an empty file in boot directory: "ssh"
		c. If Pi is booted, can enable ssh in raspi-config
			`sudo raspi-config`
				> 3. Interface Options
					> P2 SSH
						> Yes
						> Ok
				> Finish
		# default username:password = pi:raspberry
		# w/ sudo, can change password: `sudo passwd pi`

	`ssh pi@raspberrypi.local`
