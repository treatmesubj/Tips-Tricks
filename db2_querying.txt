**On "Refresh All" you probably want your queries to fully refresh before you refresh your pivots, especially if you're using a macro
	Data > Queries & Connections
		Right-click your query
		> Properties
			>x (Deselect) Enable background refresh

**You may want to change the logic/composition of your resulting table
	Data > Queries & Connections
		Right-click your query
		> Edit

**Things to Consider
	Data Types of your columns
	Cleaning your SQL results
	If you want to imitate a complicated analytical query,
		you may need to merge multiple queries
		you may need to translate any calculated column logic
