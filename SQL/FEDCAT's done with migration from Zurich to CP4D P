FEDCAT's done with migration from Zurich to CP4D Prod BigSQL
I migrated our consumption over and everything's working

DevOps stuff I had to update some secrets in the OpenShift cluster and restart a pod
Then for DBA stuff I rebuilt the DDL table structure for the tables in our DB2
Then for data engineer stuff I updated the Airflow jobs and merged my pull request
